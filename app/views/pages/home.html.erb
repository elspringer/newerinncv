<h1 class="fancystuff">Hello Girls Are Awesome <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
<p>I'm Erinn, a web developer, content writer, digital marketer & <i>occasional</i> sashayer when I'm really feeling myself.</p>
<p>This is my official application for the Brand Comms and Editorial Manager position at Girls Are Awesome. I hope you find it proper, maybe a bit over the top, and that it expresses my deep interest to become a part of your team.</p>
<!-- <p>With a background in content and digital marketing, web development, a passion for empowering and empowered women and bit of weird taste, I think I'd be a good fit on your team.</p> -->
<p>I currently reside under the grey skies of Berlin, but am flexible to come to Copenhagen to interview, relocate or temporary locate.</p>
<p>Look forward to connecting with you all once said a white, forty-something man on LinkedIn.</p>

  <p>Here are some thoughts I've put together to hopefully impress you and land me this job. I used to wake up everyday hoping I'd no longer like men, but now I also wake up hoping to work with you.</p>
<h3 class="fancystuff">Passing the Torch Series</h3>
<p>A series focused on women helping other women in different fields, possibly fields typically dominated by men. Feel good stories and inspo for all.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <%= link_to 'Alinka Ratner', 'https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/alinka/biography', target: "_blank" %> recently posted about selling her old dj equipment to another woman. A video featuring Alinka, her British short-haired cat named Acid, and the woman who she sold the equipment to would really resemble the way that women care about other women.
  <br>The other week a panel at Native Instruments discussed the need to do more to target and market to women. Right now 95% of their customers are white males. Partnering with them to offer series, classes or discounts for women could be one way to start changing the stigma surrounding music culture in many areas.

  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Profile on "<%= link_to "You Skate Girl", "https://www.facebook.com/events/583913715072656", target: "_blank" %>" in Umea, Sweden. A skate board program focused on women and girls from the ages of 10-100 in an attempt to get more women to feel comfortable in public spaces that tend to have more men than women.</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <%= link_to "Surya Bonaly", "https://www.facebook.com/Surya.Bonaly.Official/"%>, the only Olympic figure skater who has completed a backflip and landed on ONE blade in history, is now coaching in Minnesota. LEGEND. Her story is undertold and deserves more recognition.</li>
</ul>


<!-- <h3 class="fancystuff">Profile on Hamburg Naming New Streets After Germany's Most Famous Dom and Other Women</h3>
<p>Domenica Niehoff campaigned for the rights of sex workers and helped women suffering with drug addiction. Ten other streets were named after famous women. Unfortunately, this is news.</p> -->

<h3 class="fancystuff">Features on Paula Alamillo Rodriguez and Marit Östberg.</h3>
<p>Have a profile on these two women and what they are doing for the European porn scene. Maybe have an event screening for their new films.

      <p>There's attention to detail, and then there's Erinn, who takes it to the next level.

      <p>For the past four years that I've known Erinn, I've observed this:  Erinn gets things done – period. She sets her mind to something, and she figures it out. As a business owner myself, watching her build her business from scratch was inspiring. Her propensity for action, instead of sitting around wondering what could be, is something I rarely find in others. Not to mention, she has a knack for thoughtful details and innovative approaches, whether it's in marketing her work in a unique way or creating a memorable experience for a client. Very selfishly, I wish I could hire Erinn for a role at my own company!</p>
